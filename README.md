# Servo-Motor

I used tinkercad online website to design circuit with five servos and aurduino, The servo have three connections (power, ground, signal) which are provided by the arduino,The multiple servos using  a breadboard to expand the arduino connections to all the exsisiting servos. 

I Identify the moving of servos 90 degrees
